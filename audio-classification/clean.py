Next, the list of classes in the source root directory (src_root) is retrieved. The target directory is created for each class, and if it does not exist, it is created. Next, the list of files in src_dir is retrieved and the following operations are performed for each file:
# Get the full path of the file (src_fn).
# The audio file is downsampled (downsample_mono) to make it low resolution. Sample rate (rate) and processed audio data (wav) are obtained.
# A sequence (y_mean) is obtained from which masking and averages are calculated to create an envelope on the audio signal.
# By using masking, only sound samples that exceed the envelope are taken (wav).
# The delta sample count (delta_sample) is calculated.
# If the size of the processed audio is smaller than the delta sampling number, the audio sample size is padded with zeros to match the delta sampling number and saved in the target directory.
# Otherwise, it splits the processed audio sample by the number of delta samples and saves each segment in the target directory.
